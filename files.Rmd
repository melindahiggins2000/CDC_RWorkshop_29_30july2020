## <i class="fa fa-github fa-1x"></i> **Github** Repositories

The files (R code, data, Rmarkdown files, etc) for this course have been placed into various **Github** repositories. Each of these repositories can be "Cloned or Downloaded (as a ZIP)" to your local harddrive for easy offline reference OR they can be "forked" so that a copy of the repository is "copied" into YOUR Github account. If you "fork" a copy be sure you are logged into your Github account first. Here are the **Github** repositories to date:

1. Gapminder Example (given on 01/18/2017) [https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N741gapminder1](https://github.com/melindahiggins2000/N741gapminder1)
    + This repository contains the `Rmarkdown` (RMD) and related files associated with "Lesson 2" done on 01/18/2017. These RMD files showed some initial `Rmarkdown` syntax with `R` chunks showcasing examples from the `gapminder` package, based on the vignette at [https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder).
    + This repository also contains an RMD file with some examples worked similar to what is expected for Homework 01. 

2. Private Repository for N741 at  [https://github.com/EmoryN741/coursefiles](https://github.com/EmoryN741/coursefiles). _[This is a placeholder for now]_

4. Video tutorial for creating the Github output MD format at [https://youtu.be/SY-Uo3hLC18](https://youtu.be/SY-Uo3hLC18)
    + This short (~5 min) video is on creating a “Github-flavored” markdown file. If you haven’t noticed yet, take a look back at your Github repository and look at one of your RMD files. You’ll notice that for the RMD file you can view the text and R code but no R output is shown. This is because the R code is not executed via Github (remember R is on your local machine not “in the cloud”). Instead, you need to create a “markdown” MD file that does have the R output included. To do this, there is a “github_document” output format you can use that will create a “github-flavored” MD (markdown) file that Github will display with both your R code and R output in the same document. See the RStudio documentation at [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html)
